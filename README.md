This repositry is a reimplemntation of the [variational continual learning](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1710.10628.pdf) paper by Nguyen et. Al. (2018) as part of the MLMI4 course at the university of Cambridge. The code is loosely based on that from the [original author](https://github.com/nvcuong/variational-continual-learning) however with now a pytorch based implementation.
